The function maximumSum(a, m) computes the maximum subarray sum modulo m for the prefix sums of array a. It iterates elements, building a running prefix sum modulo m, and keeps the best result seen so far; for each prefix it binary-searches a sorted list arr of previous prefix sums to find the smallest prior prefix greater than the current one, which lets it compute a candidate wrapped-around sum (current - next + m) % m that may exceed the current max; it inserts the current prefix in order into arr and finally returns the maximum modulo-sum found.
