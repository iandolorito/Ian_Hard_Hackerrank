The function chiefHopper(arr) computes the minimum initial energy required to traverse the array of heights so that you can move from the first to the last pillar: it works backwards, starting with zero required energy at the end, and for each pillar sets required = Math.ceil((required + arr[i]) / 2), which enforces the constraint that after arriving at a pillar and using its height you still have enough energy to continue; the final required value is the smallest integer starting energy that guarantees you can complete the course.
