This function computes the minimum cost to build the target string s using two operations—append a character for cost a, or copy an existing substring for cost b—with a helper maxSub(sub, rem, m) that, given a built prefix sub and the remaining suffix rem, returns the maximum length (starting from m) of a prefix of rem that already appears inside sub; buildString uses that information to fill a DP array cost from the end where for each position i it chooses the cheaper of appending one character (a + cost[i+1]) or copying any allowable substring of length up to state[i] (b + cost[i+len]), and finally returns the minimal total cost to construct s
