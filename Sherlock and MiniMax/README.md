The function sherlockAndMinimax(arr, p, q) finds an integer m in the interval [p, q] that maximizes the minimum distance to any element in arr: it first sorts arr, builds a list of promising candidates (the endpoints p and q plus midpoints between adjacent sorted elements, accounting for integer rounding), then for each candidate computes its closest distance to the numbers in arr and returns the candidate with the largest such minimum distance (breaking ties by choosing the smaller candidate).
