The function boardCutting(cost_y, cost_x) computes the minimum total cost to cut a rectangular board into 1×1 pieces by greedily taking the largest remaining horizontal or vertical cut first: it sorts the horizontal (cost_y) and vertical (cost_x) cut costs descending, then repeatedly chooses the next higher cost and adds it multiplied by the current number of segments in the perpendicular direction (tracked by h and v), which ensures the most expensive cuts apply across as many segments as possible; the code uses BigInt to avoid overflow and returns the total modulo 1,000,000,007.
